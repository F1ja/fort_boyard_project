def game():
    """
    Main function to run the entire game sequence.

    The game involves creating a team, completing various challenges,
    earning keys, and attempting to unlock the treasure room. Each game
    is recorded in the history file, and the player can choose to replay
    or view a summary after completing the game.

    Workflow:
        1. Clear the history file for the first game.
        2. Introduce the game and allow the user to form a team.
        3. Loop through challenges until three keys are earned.
        4. Enter the final challenge (treasure room).
        5. Record results in the history file and offer replay or summary.

    Global Variables:
        - `game_number`: Tracks and resets the game count.
